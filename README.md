# Pizza-Sales-Analysis-SQL

## Project Objective 

## 🍕 Pizza Sales Analysis — SQL Project

This project analyzes a pizza restaurant’s sales data from Kaggle using SQL. The goal is to understand customer buying patterns, revenue performance, and product popularity.
Key insights include total sales, best-selling pizzas, peak order times, revenue contribution by categories, and monthly/weekly performance trends.
The SQL queries used in this project help answer important business questions—such as which pizzas generate the highest revenue, which sizes sell the most, and how demand changes over time.
This analysis can be useful for decision-making, optimizing menu items, and improving overall business strategy.
